# OpenAI API client

[OpenAI API](https://platform.openai.com/docs/introduction) client generated
from the [OpenAPI](https://openapi-generator.tech) spec found in [OpenAI's
repo](https://github.com/openai/openai-openapi/tree/master).


## TODO

This is still a work in progress, and the following items are needed:

- [ ] Dynamically provide all symbols created by the macro.
- [ ] Generate request methods that accept keyword arguments instead of hashes.
- [ ] Generate response structs and return that instead of hashes.
- [ ] Extract the `openapi` macro into a separate repo.
